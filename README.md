The goal of this programming project is to implement intelligent agents for the game of Pacman. The project is divided into three parts:  

Project I: implementing a Search agent for eating all the food dots as quickly as possible.  
Project II: implementing a Minimax agent for eating all the food dots as quickly as possible, while avoiding the ghost enemies that are chasing you.  
Project III: implementing a Bayes filter for tracking all the non-visible ghosts' positions.
